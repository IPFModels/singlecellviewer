iAT2_ILD_Disease_modeling,"UMAPs showing characterization of gene expression in SFTPCI73T/tdT (clone 'C11') iPSC-derived alveolar epithelial type 2-like cells (iAEC2s or iAT2s) compared to syngeneic, edited SFTPCtdT/WT iAEC2s (clone 'B2'). Clustering of day 114 scRNA-seq transcriptomes is shown for each indicated iAEC2 population using Uniform Manifold Approximation Projection (UMAP). All live iAEC2s, irrespective of SFTPCtdTomato expression at this time point are included.",human,RDS
I73T_AlveolarEpithelial,"To capture representative proportions of all major parenchymal and immune cell populations, we profiled IER-SftpcI73T/ Ptgfr+/+ and IER-SftpcI73T/ Ptgfr-/- animals with oral TAM and harvested the lungs at 14 and 28 days (n=2 per genotype per time point). Controls (n= 4) consisted of one mouse each of uninduced IER-SftpcI73T/ Ptgfr+/+, IER-SftpcI73T/ Ptgfr-/-, SftpcWT/ Ptgfr+/+, and SftpcWT/ Ptgfr-/- genotypes. This is the Mesenchyme and Alveolar Epithelial object.",mouse,RDS
